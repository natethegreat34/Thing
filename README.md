Chong and Derek worked on the Ball methods and tried to make it stay in boundary, still working on it.

5/8/19
Early Morning: Derek added the Collideable interface, but due to the nature of the display method in Ball and Derek's lack of computer science experience/lack of knowledge of java/lack of will to dig deeply to learn completely how processing3 works, he has saved this part for the next day.
