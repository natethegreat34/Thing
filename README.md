James worked on LivingRock move.
Nathan worked on LivingRock display.
Derek worked on Ball move.
Chong worked on Ball display.

5/7/19
Chong and Derek worked on the Ball methods and tried to make it stay in boundary, still working on it.
Afternoon: Derek has successfully made Ball stay in boundary.

5/8/19
Early Morning: Derek added the Collideable interface, but due to the nature of the display method in Ball and Derek's lack of computer science experience/lack of knowledge of java/lack of will to dig deeply to learn completely how processing3 works, he has saved this part for the next day.
James : added eyes to the living rock

5/9/19:
Derek Lao; Add red and tested code to make rock colliding with ball to produce red. Also added FPS thing, maybe helpful.

5/11/19:
Chong : Edited display method of the Ball class so that it is compatible with the collideable interface. Also added display method for BallTwo, which is one of the subclass of the Ball class.

5/12/19:
Chong:
Added a display method for BallOne, the other subclass of the Ball class. The different display methods for the two subclasses ensure that they appear differently. Also edited display for BallTwo so that it turns blue when it collides with a rock rather than turning red.
